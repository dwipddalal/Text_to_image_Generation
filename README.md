# Text_to_image_Generation
I have started working on the text to image generation problem statement.
- I have downloaded the MS COCO dataset and written some utility functions for performing preprocessing on the images
- I have made the model for creating text embeddings using sentence BERT.
- I have also immpelmented the model architecture stage-1 of the stack-GAN.

Next I am going to begin the complilation of this model.
